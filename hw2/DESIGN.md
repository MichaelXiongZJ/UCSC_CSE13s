next_collatz_steps:
	three if loops for when n = 1 || even || odd
count_collatz_steps:
	Use recursion with 3 conditions: N==1(base case), N%2==0, else.
	Return +1 everytime the recursion loops.

maximum:
	Run a loop len times to check the elements in the array.
	Create a temp int and copy to it when the num in the array in bigger.

sum_positives:
	Create a int temp, add to it when element > 0

count_negative:
	Create a int count, add 1 to it when element < 0
